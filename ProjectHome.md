wowmapper can parse any map file for you. It's a little library that's heavily commented. It should be easy to customize/use it since the folder and source layout is structured to resemble the [documentation](http://www.madx.dk/wowdev/wiki/) and it includes a number of samples to get started. The library is written in C++ and uses [libmpq](https://libmpq.org/) and [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/) as supporting libraries. I hope you like it.

Last but not least, a big THANKS to the people @ mmowned & gamedeception for their awesome work.

**NEWS** wowmapper is being updated and early versions are already in the trunk. Notice: there's no official version yet, and wowmapper may contain heavy bugs and won't be able to parse all data correctly. You have been warned!
