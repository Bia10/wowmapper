This is just a little description for the lazy people who just want to
export the map files and don't care about the code.

Usage example on Windows:
Sample_MeshExporter C:\WoW\Data World\maps\Azeroth\Azeroth


To read the *.mesh data you need to know the following:

Bounding box chunk (28 bytes):
id		char[4] (BBX)
size		size_t
bbmin		float[3]
bbmax		float[3]

ADT position chunk (8 bytes):
id		char[4] (POS)
size		size_t
x		int
y		int

Index chunk:
id		char[4] (IDX)
size		size_t (num indices)
indices 	int[size]

Vertex chunk:
id		char[4] (VTX)
size		size_t (num vertices)
vertices	float[3][size]

Have fun.
